### Submitting a (good) bug report

-   **Use a clear an descriptive title**

-   **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.** Include links to files or projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).

## Suggesting changes

Before creating enhancement suggestions, check the [Roadmap](https://assurance-maladie-digital.github.io/vue-dot/guide/roadmap.html) to see if what you want is already planned. If you don't see your suggestion, [create a new issue](#submitting-a-good-bug-report).
